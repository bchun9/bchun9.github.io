summary: An app for finding your local representatives in Hawaii that  I developed for ICS 321.
---

The Hawaii Electeds App is an application that uses a geolocation website to find the current longitude and lattitude of your location. Then it matches the coordinates to an address, which is then used to determine who your representatives are. This app can be used by anyone who would like to know the Mayor, Congressman, State Senator, and State House Representative of their district.

The app was developed on a site called Appery.io. This website allows even beginners to be able to develop their own apps by taking the coding aspect out of the equation and instead allows users to create apps using actions. 

In the process of completing this project I learned about the intricacies of creating mobile apps.
