summary: My group walked around the UH Manoa campus looking for unsecured wireless networks.

For the ICS 425 final project, my group decided to do Warwalking. Warwalking is the act of going from location to location while continuously searching for unsecured wireless networks. The goal of the project was not to do anything to any unsecured wireless networks but rather to be able to report it so that they may be secured. My group and I walked from building to building on the UH Manoa campus in search of unsecured wireless networks. We used an application on our phones to note down any wireless networks that we came across named WiGLE WiFi. Initially, we were to use a program named NetStumbler to log any information about the wireless networks but the network adapters on our laptops were not compatible. WiGLE WiFi is a free application for mobile devices that is an open source alternative to NetStumbler.

For this project, I collaborated with my group to plan out the route that we would take to search for the most possible wirless networks. Once we downloaded WiGLE WiFi on our mobile devices, all we had to do was walk the route that we planned out and the device would take note of the wireless networks we came into contact with. The application would then log the information of the wireless networks and store the data in a file that we would later look at to analyze which networks were secured or insecured. After collecting the data, we then proceeded to write our findings in our final paper as well as create a PowerPoint presentation.

Any person would be able to do this project and search for wireless networks with the same applications and techniques we used. It shows how accessible technology in the present time. The data that is collected can be used for multiple purposes, good and bad.
