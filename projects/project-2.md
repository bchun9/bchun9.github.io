summary: A website developed in ICS 321 using Wordpress.
---


This is a website that was made in ICS 321 to show a visual representation of a database. It also contains other projects from ICS 321.

Wordpress was used to manage and organize the pages of the website.

In this project I gained experience with HTML, databases, and general website layout. The pages of the website were coded in HTML. I learned how to manipulate the database using myPHP admin and MySQL statements.
