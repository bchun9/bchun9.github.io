<p>I would like to say that I love Meteor and everything about Meteor, but I would be lying. When using Meteor, I have no idea what I'm doing or even what the code does.  My entire experience so far with Meteor can be described by two words, copy and paste. Throughout this entire section on Meteor, I have just been copying and pasting code and modifying it to fit whatever the assignment is. One could argue that copying and pasting code is very similar to something that might be done in a future career. If the code is already accessible online and there are deadlines that need to be met, copy-paste is inevitable.
