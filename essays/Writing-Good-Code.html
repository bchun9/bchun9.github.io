What does it mean to write "good" code? When I took a course on C and C++ with Professor Ravi Narayan in Spring 2016, one of the first things he taught me was how to write "good" code. He explained that in the past, programs focused heavily on minimizing data consumption. Programmers did not have the same computing capabilities that we have today, so they had to write code that minimized the amount of data that the program would use. Every character, space, indent, and new-line was taken into account so that their programs did not exceed the data limits. The code that the programmers created was often difficult to read and understand, thus resulting in communication complications. Narayan told us that "good" code is readable code that anyone would be able to pick it up and say: "This code looks easy to write".
