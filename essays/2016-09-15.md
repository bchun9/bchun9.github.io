Configuration management is important for Software Engineering because it allows groups of people to efficiently maintain the files for projects.  I agree that software hosting platforms are very useful when collaborating with multiple people, but it comes with its disadvantages.  If one or more users are not familiar with a particular software hosting platform, then it can cause some confusion within the group.  Not knowing how to use the features of the software hosting platform can increase the amount of time spent on trying to manage the files.  I spent about one hour trying to figure out how to access the files of the repository to submit this essay.  

To be honest I have never heard of git before taking this Software Engineering class.  So I am not sure which gained its popularity because of the other, GitHub or git.  I have heard of GitHub in the past but I did not know anything about it, just the name.  Not being familiar with git and GitHub can be attributed to the lack of need of the software hosting platform in the past.
