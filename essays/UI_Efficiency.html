<h2>User Interface Frameworks</h2>
<p>The value that I can see in learning a UI Framework is that it allows you to be more efficient with your time and it can also make your code easier to read. In the beginning stages of learning a UI Framework, like Semantic UI, it can be quite difficult to grasp exactly how to use the many classes available to you. However, once you get into the rhythym of learning the classes, it becomes very easy to implement it into your own code. There are also some features of UI Frameworks that if you tried to replicate it by just using HTML and CSS it would take you a long time.

<h2>Utilize</h2>
<p>One of the cool things about Semantic UI is that once you use a particular class in your code, you can now use that snippet of code for many different projects. When coding different websites, I found that the same Semantic UI classes could be used for different purposes. Websties are also very similar to eachother. Every website usually has a navigation bar at the top, a background image, and a footer at the bottom of the page displaying additional information. To use snippets of Semantic UI code, you simply copy it from one project to the next and change the values to display the correct information. Utilizing UI Frameworks can also decrease the amount of smaller classes that you would have to code if you were using just CSS.
