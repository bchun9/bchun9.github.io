I found that Javascript was very similar to Java and C. The difficulty of Javascript is somewhere between Java and C. At least with Java and Javascript you do not have to worry about pointers. While learning Javascript is fairly easy, I am unaware of the application of Javascript to the real world. The main goals that I have when learning a new language is to first evaluate if I like the language, then find some practical uses for it, and then finally think of a project that interests me and can further my understanding.
