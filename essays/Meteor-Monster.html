<p>I would like to say that I love Meteor and everything about Meteor, but I would be lying. When using Meteor, I have no idea what I'm doing or even what the code does.  My entire experience so far with Meteor can be described by two words, copy and paste. Throughout this entire section on Meteor, I have just been copying and pasting code and modifying it to fit whatever the assignment is. One could argue that copying and pasting code is very similar to something that might be done in a future career. If the code is already accessible online and there are deadlines that need to be met, copy-paste is inevitable.

<p>I honestly have nothing to write in terms of Meteor because of the many problems that I came across when trying to run Meteor. The frustration of not being able to see the results of running the code made me not want to use Meteor. So far, I have been trying to create Meteor applications without actually seeing what the application looks like on the browser. Will I ever use Meteor in the future? Unless a job requires me to use Meteor, I probably will not ever use Meteor again.
